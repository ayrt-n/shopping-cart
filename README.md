# JavaScript Shopping Cart

## Overview

This is a project as part of the React section of The Odin Project's JavaScript course (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-shopping-cart).

The problem involved creating an online store with a functioning shopping cart. The project helped cement two concepts from two different lessons: React-router, as well as writing tests for React components.

Through the app there are two pages which users are able to navigate to, controlled by react-router; the homepage and the shop. In the shop users are able to select the item they want, the quantity, and then add it to their cart. The cart will then be updated with the item, quantity, and total price.

Full test suite for all react components and functionality done using the jest.
